# Homework

## Task 1
In the first handon [1 - s3_lamda_gateway_api.md](1%20-%20s3_lamda_gateway_api.md), you may notice that we manually create
S3 and copy file over it. Can you do it using Terraform?

Tip: Refer to https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket.html and https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket_object.html

## Task 2
Use Terraform to add a static website in S3 to call API Gateway as the frontend
